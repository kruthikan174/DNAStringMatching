ðŸ§¬ Bioinformatics Sequence Analysis Toolkit

This repository contains an interactive Streamlit-based toolkit for exploring biological sequence analysis.
It combines classical alignment algorithms, mutation simulation, and case studies to help students and researchers understand molecular evolution.

ðŸ“Œ Features

ðŸ”¹ 1. Sequence Alignment (Home.py)

Global Alignment (Needlemanâ€“Wunsch) â€“ Aligns entire sequences with gap penalties.

Local Alignment (Smithâ€“Waterman) â€“ Finds the best-matching subsequences.

Customizable Parameters â€“ Match, mismatch, and gap penalties.

Outputs:

Alignment score

Aligned sequences with mismatches highlighted

Dynamic programming (DP) score matrix heatmap

ðŸ”¹ 2. Horspool Pattern Search (horspool.py)

Efficient pattern searching inspired by Horspoolâ€™s algorithm.

Compares substrings between two sequences for local alignment.

Highlights mismatches, gap penalties, and best matching regions.

Visualizations:

Alignment score heatmap

Score distribution histogram

ðŸ”¹ 3. Mutation Simulation Tools (Mutation Simulation Tools.py)

Manual mutation editor â€“ Introduce substitutions, insertions, deletions.

Random mutation generator â€“ Simulates mutation probability across sequences.

Alignment comparison â€“ See how mutations affect global alignment score.

Visualizations:

Mutation effects on alignment

Distribution of random mutation scores

ðŸ”¹ 4. Case Studies: Cytochrome C Evolution

Compare Cytochrome C protein sequences across primates (human, chimp, gorilla, orangutan, macaque).

Analyze evolutionary relationships using alignment scores.

Visual outputs:

Heatmap of pairwise alignment scores

Bar plot of sequence similarity

ðŸ“Š Tech Stack

Python â€“ Core implementation

Streamlit â€“ Interactive web-based UI

NumPy / Pandas â€“ Data handling & calculations

Matplotlib / Seaborn â€“ Heatmaps & plots

Biopython (optional future extension) â€“ Advanced sequence utilities

ðŸš€ Future Enhancements
